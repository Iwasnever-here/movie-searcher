## 📍 The Process
To practice working with APIs and react routing I thought I would make a simple movie and tv searching site using the TMDB API. After displaying the popular movies, I moved on to implement the search - which was alot more complicated as I had to figure out how to handle the input for the search, but after I figured this out I was easily able to implement the Tv side of things
